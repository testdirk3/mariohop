If you got your foreign passport or have just applies for it, it’s tim
e to think about buying airplane tickets. You can buy tickets at ticket offices or book
flights online. Moreover, don’t forget to get travel insurance. As a rule, it’s required (it’s obligatory).
The tickets are on hand, the insurance is in a pocket, a suitcase is packed – it’s time to go to the airport.
You should arrive at the airport two hours earlier whether you fly in business class or in economy class. Why? In order to go to check-in counter (desk) and afterwards
to passport control. If you don’t like traveling light, you will be charged for excess baggage.
Thst’s it – it’s high time you boarded ( g
ot on) a place. It will take off any moment. We hop
